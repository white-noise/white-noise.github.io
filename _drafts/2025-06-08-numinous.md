watched the royal tennenbaums; some sense that its texture was tethered to deferral. the usual fear that it might be too late---that asking this means you know the answer. that you thought your relationships, despite their shittiness, their banal shittiness, were not at least imminently set to dissolve, or to be revealed as something different than what you thought they were, and so at least there was time. in the movie it is too late. and this is made worse by reflection on context: everyone sees everyone else's desire's misplacement. everyone begins to panic. novel alignments emerge. this is then sort of couched in WA's usual antics, and can come across as flippant, but how can I know whether these might be required for me to accept the raw, glistening bits. the end feeling is of course my own: that i am so far from anyone i have loved, and for no clear reason on close inspection. there is only love and connection in the hypothetical here.

desire for singular and dissafected textual sources; imperfect books by dedicated, obsessed authors immediately lost to cultural memory upon their deaths. the kind of people whose effect is in the lucid but middling writing styles of their former students now teaching at quiet mid-tier american universities.
